<p>Welcome to Python Programming Fundamentals Second Edition by Kent D. Lee. This text, available from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Fundamentals-Undergraduate-Computer-Science/dp/1447166418/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423423068&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=python+kent+d+lee">Springer</a>, is an introductory computer programming text. The text is oriented towards students who have not taken any other programming course previously. However, it can be used by students with some programming skills in another language. If you would like to begin learning Python programming on your own, you can begin by installing Python and Wing IDE 101 on your computer. Then buy my book and begin working through the many practice exercises and examples in the text. The links to the two YouTube videos below show you how you can install Python and Wing IDE 101 on your computer.</p>

<section id="chapter-1">
<h2>Chapter 1<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-1" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first chapter is about 30 pages long and contains a variety of learning objectives. This is perhaps the most broadly focused of the chapters in the text. Its goal is to give you some basis for talking about computer programming and to give you a gentle introduction to the process of writing programs. Specifically, the learning objectives of the first chapter are outlined below.</p>

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</section>
<section id="chapter-2">
<h2>Chapter 2<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-2" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In chapter 2 you learn how to make decisions in your programs using if statements. An if statements alters the sequence of executed statements depending on a condition. You also learn about the guess and check pattern of computation. This pattern is important to learn and memorize because you use it over and over in programs you write. Learning objectives for this chapter are outlined below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvtgfRkRzQo&amp;index=13&amp;list=PL1DE477438120C9EF">Sections 2.1 &amp; 2.2</a> - Here you learn about the guess and check pattern of computation. You can watch this video that goes along with these chapters.</p></li>

<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fr1rcElLCI&amp;index=15&amp;list=PL1DE477438120C9EF">Section 2.6</a> - In this section we learn that floating point numbers are only approximations of real numbers and therefore we must take some care when comparing floats for equality. It is likely that two floats will be close to the same value, but not exactly the same value, even when we would like them to be equal. The video below helps to illustrate this problem and the solution to it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 2 Support Files<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-2-support-files" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In exercise 2 of chapter 3 the problem asks you to write a menu driven address book program. You can use <a class="reference external" href="http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/IntroToComputing/addressbook.txt">this text file</a> as the data file for your address book or you can create one yourself. Just be sure to use the same format as is presented in the book for your records within the file.</p>

<section id="chapter-3">
<h2>Chapter 3<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-3" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In chapter 3 you learn how to repeatedly execute code in programs so you can process repetitive data. This is where computers really are important, since people don’t like to do the same thing over and over again. Computers are good at doing the same thing over and over. Again, there are video lectures below that complement the text.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">

<section id="chapter-4">
<h2>Chapter 4<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-4" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In chapter 4 you learn about objects and how to create objects and call methods on them. The chapter uses turtle graphics and XML parsing as two examples where many objects are created and methods are called.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-4fllTfZPU">Sections 4.1 to 4.3</a> - The introduction and these sections of the text show you how to use modules in Python and how to create some objects. This video complements these sections of the text.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w041yfwiy64">Plotting Data</a> - In this video you learn how to use turtle graphics to plot data that you read from a file. In this video I read the file called <a class="reference external" href="_static/djia-100.txt">djia-100.txt</a>. This file is provided here for you to download if you want to try out my example.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbsU9VL54l4">Section 4.8</a> - In this section of the text you learn about dictionaries in Python. It shows you how to create a dictionary, put a key/value pair in dictionary, and how to lookup a key in a dictionary to get its value. The video below demonstrates these concepts as well.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2qlCZhkwtE">Sections 4.6 to 4.9</a> - In these sections of the text you learn how to read and parse through the information in an XML file. XML documents are used in many different applications these days and understanding what an XML document is and how to read it in a program is a valuable skill. The video below helps to illustrate these ideas. This video use an XML file called <a class="reference external" href="_static/kml.kml">kml.kml</a> as an example. That file can be downloaded here if you want to try my example.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYNldaCrEq0">Section 4.7</a> - In this section of the text I show you how to get at the attributes in an XML element. The attributes are recorded as a dictionary so you’ll want to know what a dictionary is first (see section 4.8 and its video above). In the video that goes along with this section I read a couple of XML files called <a class="reference external" href="_static/biking3-15-2012.tcx">biking3-15-2012.tcx</a> and <a class="reference external" href="_static/biking3-15-2012.tcx">workouts.tcx</a>. You can download these files here if you want to try my examples, but these files are large and a little unwieldy. You might start with some smaller XML files first (see the exercises at the end of the chapter in the text).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Support Files<a class="headerlink" href="#support-files" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In chapter 4 there are several programming problems that must read data from a file. In a few cases, some code is provided to get you started. Each exercise’s extra files are provided below.</p>

<section id="chapter-6">
<h2>Chapter 6<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-6" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Chapter 6 introduces Tkinter programming through an example Reminder application. Documentation for the Tkinter API can be found here. You can download the Reminder.py code from the example in that chapter here.
Exercise 4 requires you to create an XML file to hold the reminder notes when the program is terminated and for the program to read when the application is started. You can use the format found below for your XML file. Name the file “Reminders.xml” and place the xml file in the same directory or folder as your program. You can begin this exercise by downloading the Reminder.py program from the link above and then modifying the code to read from an XML file using the minidom parser described in chapter 4. You can write to a file using Python’s file write method like the code in Reminder.py already does. Of course, you need to modify the code to write the file in this XML format so it can be read by the minidom parser.</p>
<p>One thing to be aware of: When using double quotes (i.e. “) in strings, you can you single quotes (i.e. ‘) to delimit those strings. Python lets you use either double or single quotes to delimit strings and this is one instance where using single quotes will come in handy.</p>
<p>One other thing to be aware of: Sometimes exception handling code (i.e. try except statements) get in the way of debugging your code. You may want to remove (or just comment out) the try except statements in the Reminders.py program before making modifications to it so you can see what errors occur when you make the modifications for this assignment. You should put the try except statements back in once you have debugged your code.</p>
